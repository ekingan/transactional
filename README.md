This is a simulation of a command line key value store written in Ruby.

* Ruby version 2.3.0 (When I changed to version 2.6.1 it worked fine).

### Running this project

To run, clone this repo, then from within the root directory enter `ruby app.rb` to run the simulation.

To run tests, `gem install rspec`, then `rspec --init`, then run `rspec` from the root of the project.
